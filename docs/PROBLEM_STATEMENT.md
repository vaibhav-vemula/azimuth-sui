# The Problem Azimuth Solves

Traditional satellite ground station networks are **centralized, expensive, and opaque**. A handful of corporations control who receives satellite data, where it's stored, and who gets access — creating single points of failure, coverage gaps, and zero incentive for independent operators to participate.

Research teams and businesses that need satellite data are priced out by the enormous costs of cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure) and the prohibitive expense of building and maintaining their own ground stations — hardware, licensing, maintenance, and operational overhead that only the largest organizations can afford.

**Azimuth makes satellite ground infrastructure accessible to anyone.**

## What Azimuth Changes

**Fragmented reception → Collaborative recovery**
A single ground station only catches a fraction of packets as a satellite passes overhead. Azimuth coordinates multiple independent stations to receive the same pass simultaneously, merging their data into a complete image — recovering packets no single station could alone.

**Centralized storage → Permanent, uncensorable record**
Every merged satellite image is uploaded to Arweave and its transaction ID anchored on Hedera, making it permanently retrievable by anyone, forever — no corporation can delete or gatekeep it.

**Trusted intermediaries → On-chain proof**
Reception events are cryptographically proven on-chain via PoRx (Proof of Reception).
Anyone can verify which station received which packets, when, and how many — no trust required.

**Unpaid operators → Token incentives**
Station operators earn AZM tokens automatically for every heartbeat (PoA) and every
satellite pass they receive (PoRx), paid out by a self-executing smart contract with no human in the loop.

## Who Can Use It

| Use case | How Azimuth helps |
|---|---|
| **Research teams** | Access raw satellite imagery without AWS/Azure bills or the $100k+ cost of building a dedicated ground station |
| **Universities** | Run a student-operated node on a Raspberry Pi — no enterprise contracts, no gatekeepers |
| **Startups & SMBs** | Get satellite data coverage at a fraction of traditional infrastructure costs |
| **Disaster response teams** | Redundant, decentralized reception ensures data survives infrastructure outages |
| **Hardware hobbyists** | Turn a Raspberry Pi + LoRa radio into a revenue-generating ground station |
| **Web3 developers** | Build applications on top of a verifiable, permanent satellite data layer |
| **DePIN investors** | Stake in physical infrastructure with transparent, on-chain proof of contribution |
